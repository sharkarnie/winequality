# Using Logistic Regression to Predict Wine Quality & Wine Type

Two datasets containing information from red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine were provided for the challenge. The red and white wine datasets each contain results from physicochemical tests of the wines:

fixed acidity (g / dm^3)
volatile acidity (g / dm^3)
citric acid (g / dm^3)
residual sugar (g / dm^3)
chlorides (g / dm^3)
free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
total sulphur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
density (g / cm^3)
pH (0 to 14)
sulphates (g / dm^3)
alcohol (% by volume)
and a rank of wine quality from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent) based on a sensory analysis carried out by wine experts.

The aims of the challenge were to:

(i) Determine the factors that predict wine quality

(ii) Determine the factors that predict wine type (red or white)
